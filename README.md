# Restaurant-Management-system

ðŸŒŸ **Welcome to the Restaurant Management System Project** ðŸŒŸ

This is a simple Python-based Restaurant Management System that allows users to interact with a menu, place orders, and manage the restaurant's menu items. The system includes options for filtering dishes by categories, adding new dishes to the menu, and processing customer orders. It is a command-line-based application designed to help restaurant managers streamline their ordering process.
